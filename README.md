# Comparative Study of CNN Architectures for Fruit Classification: Performance and Efficiency Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the project "Comparative Study of CNN Architectures for Fruit Classification: Performance and Efficiency Analysis." The project focuses on using various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify fruits as fresh or rotten, comparing their performance and efficiency.


## DataSet
The dataset used in this project was retrieved from Kaggle. It consists of images categorized into fresh and rotten fruit classes for apples, bananas, and oranges. The dataset is split into training and testing sets:

-Training set: 10901 images

-Testing set: 2698 images

Each set contains images of fresh and rotten apples, oranges, and bananas.

## Features

- Color: Differentiates based on brightness and discoloration.
- Texture: Identifies surface smoothness, roughness, or blemishes.
- Shape: Detects deformations or typical fruit shapes.
- Size: Considers the fruitâ€™s dimensions in combination with other features.
- Edges and Contours: Analyzes the clarity of edges and outlines.
- Patterns: Looks for specific patterns like spots or stripes.
