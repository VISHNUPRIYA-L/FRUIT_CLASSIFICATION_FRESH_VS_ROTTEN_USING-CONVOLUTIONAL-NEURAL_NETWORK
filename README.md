# FRUIT_CLASSIFICATION_FRESH_VS_ROTTEN_USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL_NETWORK
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of fresh and rotten fruits. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled fruit images, leveraging deep learning techniques to accurately distinguish between fresh and spoiled produce.
